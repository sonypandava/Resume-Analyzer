The main purpose of building this project is to create a smart technology for student 
to analyse their resume. Nowadays there are many job descriptions and many domains for jobs.
Our Aim is to provide a smart system that can give the perfect recommendation based on the resume of user, 
It will give the recommendation of Job working industry, tools & Technology, courses, and resume writing techniques.
So, with this the user can create a better resume that will increase the chances of getting a job in good company.
 Feasibility analysis begins once the goals are defined. It starts by generating 
broad  possible  solutions, which are possible to give an indication of what 
the new system should look like. This is where creativity and imagination are
 used. Analysts must think up new ways of doing things- generate new ideas. 
There is no need to go into the detailed system operation yet. The solution 
should provide enough information to make reasonable estimates about project 
cost and give users an indication of how the new system will fit into the 
required organization. It is important not to exert considerable effort at this stage 
only to find out that the project is not worthwhile or that there is a need signific
antly change the original goal.
In current situation there are thousands of unemployed people finding the job but they are 
can’t able to select in the companies, the reason is they don’t know the trend of current technology & fields.
Maybe they are lacking with the skills of resume writing. It is chances that they didn’t have done any particular
certifications in particular field. So, our ideas is to implement Artificial Intelligence in this field. AI Technology 
is playing a very vital role in changing our life in many ways. There are many sectors which benefited after implementing AI 
technology in it. Now it’s time for evolution in very field. With the use of Artificial Intelligence every field is growing widely. 
With this project our aim is to use AI in job sectors. This system can be use by any fresher or graduate. Our future aim to create same module 
for companies oriented also, so with this application companies can directly shortlist the people using AI. We are using the core concepts of 
Natural Language Processing for analysing the resume. This is just first step for implementing Artificial Intelligence in the field of Job Recruitment .
